## Lesson 2 -- Allow statements 

Polar policy files provide applications with knowledge about _who_ can access _what_.

Oso is a policy engine that reads polar policy files to form a knowledge base of permissions. Queries can be passed to the engine, and the provided result informs whether a matching permission exists. This result can be used to grant or deny access accordingly.

**Allow statements** define which *actors* can *act* on which *resource*.

> allow(user, action, resource);

For example, the following statement allows `harley` to `read` any resource:

> allow("harley","read", _);

In contrast the following statement only allows `harley` to read `book` resources:

> allow("harley","read","book");
